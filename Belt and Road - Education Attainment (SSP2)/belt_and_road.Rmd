```{r include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)
```

This is a reproducible example to produce a tile map that shows forecasted education attainment for ages 15 to 39 for belt and road countries based on the SSP2 scenario.

## Libraries
```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
library(geofacet)
library(kani)

source("../grids.R")
options(scipen = 99)
```

**Note:** I have used a library called ```kani``` which has some theme aesthetics for plotting. It can be installed by using ```devtools::install_github("kanishkamisra/kani")``` in your R console.

## Data import

We use data from Wittgenstein Center...

```{r data_import}
belt_road <- read_csv("belt_road_countries.csv")

belt_road <- belt_road %>%
  filter(Education != "Total" & Education != "Under 15" & Year <= 2050) %>%
  group_by(Area, Scenario, Year, Education) %>%
  summarise(Population = sum(Population))

edu_levels <- rev(c("No Education", "Incomplete Primary", "Primary", "Lower Secondary", "Upper Secondary", "Post Secondary"))

belt_road$Education <- factor(belt_road$Education, levels = edu_levels)

# Colors
red = "#ff7473"
blue = "#47b8e0"
yellow = "#ffc952"
green = "#8cd790"
purple = "#6a60a9"
orange = "#f68657"
```

## Plot for one country (SSP2)

As an example, we can plot the forecasted education attainment for ages 15-39 for Hungary. The tile plot introduced in the next section would just be a series of such plots arranged in a specific manner(relative to geographic alignment).

```{r Hungary}
hungary_education <- belt_road %>%
  filter(Area == "Hungary" & Scenario == "SSP2") %>%
  ggplot(aes(Year, Population, group = Education, fill = Education)) + 
  geom_area() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(red, blue, yellow, green, purple, orange)) +
  theme_kani() +
  theme(
    legend.position = "top",
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "white"),
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white"),
    legend.background = element_rect(fill = "white"),
    legend.key = element_rect(fill = "white"),
    strip.background = element_rect(fill = "white"),
    strip.text.x = element_text(face = "bold")
  ) + 
  labs(
    Y = "Population per 1000 people"
  )

ggsave("hungary_education.png", hungary_education, height = 4, width = 6)
```

## Defining the Grid

In order to implement grids for the ```geofacet``` package to plot the area plots relative to the countries' position on a world map, we define a grid as per ```geofacet```'s guidelines that takes the row and column values as well as identifiers for the countries and aligns the plots accordingly.

The grid for belt and road is shown as follows:

```{r}
obor_grid <- data.frame(
  row = c(1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5,
          6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8,
          9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 10, 10, 10, 11),
  col = c(4, 5, 3, 4, 12, 3, 4, 8, 9, 12, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 7, 10, 13,
          14, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 9, 11, 12, 14, 3,
          5, 8, 12, 3, 4, 5, 11, 14, 4, 5, 11, 3),
  name = c("Poland", "Russia", "Germany", "Hungary", "Mongolia", "Austria", "Serbia",
           "Kazakhstan", "Kyrgyzstan", "China", "Spain", "Italy", "Greece", "Turkey",
           "Georgia", "Uzbekistan", "Tajikistan", "Turkmenistan", "Nepal", "Macao",

           "Malaysia", "Indonesia", "Rwanda", "Tanzania", "Singapore", "Angola"),
  code = c("POL", "RUS", "DEU", "HUN", "MNG", "AUT", "SRB", "KAZ", "KGZ", "CHN", "ESP",

           "NGA", "LKA", "THA", "VNM", "PHL", "CMR", "ETH", "MDV", "KHM", "GAB", "UGA",
           "KEN", "MYS", "IDN", "RWA", "TZA", "SGP", "AGO"),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

knitr::kable(obor_grid)
```

## Grid Preview

```{r obor_grid_prev}
grid_prev <- grid_preview(obor_grid) + theme_minimal()
ggsave("obor_grid.png", grid_prev)
